// Starvation is a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress.
// This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads.
// For example, a thread that is waiting for a lock will be blocked until the lock becomes available.
// If the lock is held by a thread that never releases it, the waiting thread will be blocked indefinitely.
